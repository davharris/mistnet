Why do species live where they do?
========================================================
- What species will we find in unexplored conditions?
- Which species can co-occur?



========================================================
incremental: true

# Null models:
## Simulate assemblages from *intentionally unrealistic* rules
* Study differences between simulations and reality

<br></br>

# Alternative approach:
## Simulate *realistic* assemblages
* Use models as simplified proxies for reality

========================================================
# We don't have good general-purpose methods for simulating realistic assemblages
// examples of recent papers 

Generating realistic assemblages: today's roadmap:
========================================================
## - Model criteria and goals
## - Key ingredients
## - Examples

Two criteria:
========================================================
incremental: true
## - Out-of-sample accuracy
* Necessary condition for treating the model as a proxy for reality


## - Connection to the biology
* Can specify ecological hypotheses using model structure
* Can build in ecological knowledge from other sources

Key ingredients :
========================================================
